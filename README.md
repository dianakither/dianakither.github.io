# My Portfolio


## Introduction  

Hi, my name is Diana and I am a veterinarian with a passion for science and data. After a successful 18 year career in  clinical practice I have achieved everything I set out to and therefore it is now time to follow my other passion, data and analytics and how data can be harnessed to improve decisions and optimise outcomes. In 2021, I completed my Graduate Diploma of Science (Applied Data Science) in preparation for a change of career. This repository contains a collection of files related to projects I have worked on throughout my studies as I continue to develop my skills in the field and Data Science and Analytics.


## Projects

### Project 1:  Analysing the Impact of Mobility on COVID-19 Infection Rates  
**Tools and Technologies:**     Python; SQL; AWS; Spark; MongoDB\
**Project Reports:**   [Analysis of Covid-19 Community Mobility Data during Lockdowns in Melbourne in 2020.pdf](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740636/Analysis.of.Covid-19.Community.Mobility.Data.during.Lockdowns.in.Melbourne.in.2020.pdf)\
[Analysis of Mobility Data and Covid-19 Infection Rates in Australia and Sweden in 2020.pdf](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740632/Analysis.of.Mobility.Data.and.Covid-19.Infection.Rates.in.Australia.and.Sweden.in.2020.pdf)\
**Code Files:**  Melbourne_Project_Code.ipynb;   Australia_and_Sweden_Project_Code.ipynb \
**Data Sets:**   [Links Covid-19 Data Sets.docx](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740675/Links.Covid-19.Data.Sets.docx)

Utilising mobility data and global clinical data compiled by Google and Our World in Data at Oxford University respectively in regards to Covid-19 cases in 2020, this project investigates the impact of mobility on the spread of Covid-19 both locally and abroad. 
The first section of the project examines the changes in mobility during the first and second lockdowns in Melbourne in 2020 in the context of case numbers and infection rates.
The second section of the project compares the changes in mobility between Australia and Sweden during lockdown restrictions and the subsequent effects on Covid-19 infection rates.


### Project 2:  Analysing Treatment Interventions and Clinical Findings for Horses with Colic 
**Tools And Technologies:**    Microsoft Excel, RapidMiner \
**Project Report:** [Data Mining Project - Colic in Horses.pdf](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740668/Data.Mining.Project.-.Colic.in.Horses.pdf) \
**Data Sets:** [Data Set Link Colic in Horses.docx](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740670/Data.Set.Link.Colic.in.Horses.docx)

In this project, a wealth of clinical case data pertaining to horses presenting with abdominal pain collected by the University of Guelph was analysed to identify trends and correlations in clinical indicators. This information was then utilised to identify key clinical indicators to determine whether a case should be managed surgically or medically.


### Project 3:  Development of a Machine Learning Predictive Model to Gauge Anaesthetic Depth

**Tools and Technologies:**  MATLAB \
**Project Report:** [Model Building Report - Depth Of Anaesthesia Index Model.pdf](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740678/Model.Building.Report.-.Depth.Of.Anaesthesia.Index.Model.pdf) \
[Final Report - Depth of Anaesthesia Index Model.pdf](https://github.com/dianakither/dianakither.github.io/files/9740819/Final.Report.-.Depth.of.Anaesthesia.Index.Model.pdf)

**Code Files:** [MATLAB Code - Model Building Depth of Anaesthesia Index Model.docx](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740680/MATLAB.Code.-.Model.Building.Depth.of.Anaesthesia.Index.Model.docx) \
[MATLAB Code - Final Report Assessment of Depth of Anaesthesia Index Model.docx](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740682/MATLAB.Code.-.Final.Report.Assessment.of.Depth.of.Anaesthesia.Index.Model.docx)

**Data Sets:** [Data set - Model Building.xlsx](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740683/Data.set.-.Model.Building.xlsx) \
[Data set - Model Testing with BIS value.xlsx](https://github.com/dianakither/myrepository/files/9740684/Data.set.-.Model.Testing.with.BIS.value.xlsx)

This project utilised machine learning techniques to design and develop a machine learning model to accurately predict a score with which to gauge anaesthetic depth using EEG data from patients under general anaesthesia. The model was validated by comparing data against the Bispectral Index, a monitoring system used to measure anaesthetic depth.


### Project 4:  Analysing Water Quality Data from European Rivers
**Tools And Technologies:**    R   \
**Project Report:** [Analysis of Water Quality Data from European Rivers.pdf] (https://github.com/dianakither/dianakither.github.io/blob/b6b5be985aa84d5bb2f918b8760cfc4590866e5e/Analysis%20of%20Water%20Quality%20Data%20from%20European%20Rivers.pdf)\
**Code Files:** [River Water Data Analysis.R] \
**Data Sets:** [Data set - rivers.csv] \
[Data set - River Water Data.xls] \

In this project, water quality data from 200 European rivers was analysised which included a number of chemical and algal distribution variables. The effect of season on water quality was investigated and whether river water quality data could be used to predict seasons.
